# HERxCQ
Our project was inspired by the movie 'HER', which is based on an AI 
that interacts with the user as an Operating System, and their relationship
soon deepens into love. With our project, 'HIM', the goal was for the
text adventure game, or "AI", to transition from strangers to friends with 
the user. We used Java and methods to build our project, and a challenge we 
ran into was incorporating and keeping tracks of multiple methods. Figuring 
out the start of our project and what we wanted to do was also another challenge we 
had to figure out. Moreover, we did complete our first-ever hackathon while
being beginners and won the Best Transition & Change Track. Our experience 
allowed us to learn more about teamwork, and coding experience with methods, 
recursion, and sleep methods. Our next step with 'HIM' is to add a GUI and voice
for the AI so it can be more user-friendly.
